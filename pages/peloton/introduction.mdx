The combination of images and text on their Contact Us page is helpful, direct, and organized.

For example, you have two routes you can take: “Need help with your hardware or order?” or “Have questions before making a purchase?”.

And each has a button connecting you to the correct department.


 
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export function Counter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    {children}{count}
  </button>
}
 
<Counter>**Clicks**: </Counter>
